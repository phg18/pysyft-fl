# pysyft-fl
To run the code it is needed to install python3, pip, PyTorch and pysyft.

Once you did it, you can run the code in 2 ways.

1. Running all the code merged:
   
    python3 federated_learning_merged.py

3. Running the code by separate:
   
    python3 00-1.py
    python3 00-2.py
    python3 00-3.py
    python3 00-4.py

    Doing it by this way, you can check everything is being executed.
